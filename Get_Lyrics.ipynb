    "### As an avid music listener, I have always had a deep appreciation for great lyrics. In my opinion, an artist's lyrics can act like a mirror into his/her soul. Websites like Genius do a fantastic job of providing lyrics for a great sum of artists. However, at this point, the website does not provide the functionality for users to summarize their favorite artist's lyrics. \n",
    "### Understanding this problem, I set out to find out a way to condense an artist's lyrics. After much thought, I figured the best way to do this would be by creating a word cloud. For those who are unaware, a Wordcloud \"is a novelty visual representation of text data, typically used to depict keyword metadata (tags) on websites, or to visualize free form text. Tags are usually single words, and the importance of each tag is shown with font size or color.[2]\" (Wikipedia)"
